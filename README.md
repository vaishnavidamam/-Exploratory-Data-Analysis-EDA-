# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
🔍 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🎯 Goal: 

This task aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the data, uncover important relationships, and generate insights that could guide future predictive modeling.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

📝 Task Highlights
🔍 Initial Exploration

Loaded dataset and reviewed structure with .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts()

Identified column types and distributions

 Data Cleaning:

 -Addressed missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked

 -Ensured consistency in data types and formats

 Univariate Analysis:

 -Analyzed individual features like Sex, Age, Pclass, and Fare

 -Used histograms, count plots, and box plots

Bivariate Analysis:

 -Explored relationships between survival and other variables

 -Studied how class, gender, age, and fare impacted survival

📈 Visualizations Used

countplot() – Categorical comparisons

histplot() – Distribution analysis

boxplot() – Outlier detection

pairplot() – Feature relationships

heatmap() – Correlation matrix

🔍 Insights & Observations:

Survival & Gender: Females had a much higher survival rate than males

Survival & Class: First-class passengers had better survival chances

Fare Factor: Higher fares generally indicated better survival odds

Missing Data: Columns like Cabin, Age, and Embarked had notable missing values and required attention
