# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
🔍 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🎯 Goal
This task aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand the data, uncover important relationships, and generate insights that could guide future predictive modeling.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas for data handling

Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting

Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation

📝 Task Highlights
🔍 Initial Exploration

Loaded dataset and reviewed structure with .info(), .describe(), and .value_counts()

Identified column types and distributions

🧹 Data Cleaning

Addressed missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked

Ensured consistency in data types and formats

📊 Univariate Analysis

Analyzed individual features like Sex, Age, Pclass, and Fare

Used histograms, count plots, and box plots

🔗 Bivariate Analysis

Explored relationships between survival and other variables

Studied how class, gender, age, and fare impacted survival

📈 Visualizations Used

countplot() – Categorical comparisons

histplot() – Distribution analysis

boxplot() – Outlier detection

pairplot() – Feature relationships

heatmap() – Correlation matrix

🔍 Insights & Observations
Survival & Gender: Females had a much higher survival rate than males

Survival & Class: First-class passengers had better survival chances

Fare Factor: Higher fares generally indicated better survival odds

Missing Data: Columns like Cabin, Age, and Embarked had notable missing values and required attention
